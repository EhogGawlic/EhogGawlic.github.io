    To use:
        To add a new ball, either press "Add ball" or click on the white box in the middle of the screen. This will place a ball where you clicked or where the x- and y- coordinates are.
        The x- and y-coordinates are on the left light gray box and say "X-" or "Y-value of ball".
        Radius is half the diameter of the ball, which is basically the width.
        Bounciness is how much speed/velocity it retains after it hits a wall. 0 is no bounce, and 1 is full velocity/speed.
        Ball color is self-explanatory.
        Weight of the ball is also.
        Density is expressed in kg/m². 78.3 kg/m² is the density of steel marbles. 
        Presets are for if you just wanna belazy and not have to search stuff up and put it in manually.
        Substeps are how many iterations are per frame, for realistic collisions.
        Auto-create balls is for if you want to make a sea of marbles.
        To select a ball, press "Select" and it should get a blue outline.
        To remove the selected ball, press "Remove". The remove button only appears if you have a selected ball.
        To clear, press "Clear".
        Oh yeah, and the unit used for everything is meters (the white thing is 500 wide and tall) and meters/second (m/s).
        There's also a FPS measurey thingy in the top right corner. It is set at 250 FPS.
    Have fun!
